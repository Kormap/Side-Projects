Okapi 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),30,4,3,4,3,5,3,"Syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. Ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather."
Podere dal Nespoli 2015 Prugneto Sangiovese (Romagna),25,4,3,4,4,4,4,This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon.
Ram 2014 Alder Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,4,2,4,3,3,3,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice and cherry. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, with lightly gritty tannins backing them up. Best suited to the dinner table."
Roland Champion NV Brut Ros챕 (Champagne),7,5,3,5,2,3,5,"This fat, yeasty Champagne is comprised predominantly of Pinot Noir. It has ripe red berry fruit, light acidity and a soft, creamy aftertaste. It's ready to drink."
Sevtap 2015 Golden Horn Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),22,5,3,5,3,3,4,"There are intriguing touches to the nose of this bottling, with jasmine, sea salt, wet hay, quinine and rainy sidewalk. The structure on the sip is quite delicate, with golden apple and honey flavors."
Simonnet-Febvre 2015 Chablis,14,5,3,5,2,2,4,"From the warm 2015 vintage, this is a soft and fruity wine. It's open with broad white fruit flavors, the acidity lighter than usual for Chablis, giving it a particularly ripe character. Drink now."
Vignerons des Terres Secr챔tes 2015 M창con-Milly Lamartine,10,4,3,4,3,3,4,"This soft, rounded wine is ripe with generous pear and melon flavors. It's easy and ready to drink young for its smooth, attractively ripe character."
Basel Cellars 2013 Inspired Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,4,3,4,3,4,3,"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. The plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes."
Cocobon 2014 Red (California),30,4,3,2,3,5,2,"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny."
Collet NV Brut Ros챕 (Champagne),12,3,3,4,4,3,4,"This cooperative, based in A첼, has benefited from the fine Pinot Noir in the village to produce a ripe red fruited wine. With balanced acidity and a soft aftertaste, it is ready to drink."
Drumheller 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),18,4,3,5,5,4,4,"Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted."
Eco Terreno 2013 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),14,4,3,4,3,5,3,"Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds."
Grifalco 2013 Daginestra (Aglianico del Vulture),28,4,4,4,4,5,2,"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, leather, underbrush, game and a briny note all carry over to the lean, somewhat disjointed palate along with suggestions of licorice and raw red cherry. Grainy tannins leave a drying finish."
Hindsight 2013 Bella Vetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),24,5,3,5,3,4,3,"Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. Tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness."
Hindsight 2012 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Calistoga),56,5,3,5,3,3,3,This is the producer's first release of this wine. Fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.
Mulvane Wine Co. 2013 The Cypher Red (Napa Valley),44,3,4,3,4,4,3,"This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin."

Z'IVO 2015 Ros챕 of Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),18,4,3,4,3,3,3,"Some ros챕s are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up."
Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2014 Brid찾o Touriga Nacional (Tejo),20,3,3,3,3,3,4,"Grown on the sandy soil of Tejo, the wine is typically soft and open. It is very accessible?봶ith black fruits and light tannins for this grape. It is ready to drink."
Aresti 2014 Special Release Reserva Carmen챔re (Rapel Valley),29,3,3,4,4,4,3,"Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins. Herbal salty plum flavors wear a lot of oaky makeup, while this finishes with a forced woody flavor."
Spyro 2014 Albari챰o (R챠as Baixas),80,3,3,3,5,3,3,"Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albari챰o. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage."
Lionel Osmin & Cie 2016 La R챕serve Petit Manseng (Vin de France),17,5,3,5,3,3,3,"This fruity, sweet wine is immediately attractive and ripe. With its great apricot and pineapple fruit, hints of spicy wood and balancing acidity, it's perfect as an ap챕ritif?봪ight and refreshing. Drink now."

Napa Cellars 2014 Classic Zinfandel (Napa Valley),17,3,3,5,3,3,3,"A healthy addition of 13% Petite Sirah provides added weight and intensity to this wine, a soft, supple and richly conceived combination of smoky black fruit and mocha."
P.J. Valckenberg 2015 Undone Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),14,4,3,4,4,3,3,"Pronounced dust, pollen and earth tones lend savoriness to this otherwise citrusy wine. Racy acidity and fresh tangerine and lemon flavors turn herbal on the finish. Drink now."

Poggio Alloro 2014 Le Mandorle Riserva (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),135,5,3,5,2,4,3,"Subdued aromas of French oak, toast and acacia waft out of the glass. The rather lean palate offers oak-driven spice, chopped herb and a hint of citrus set against racy acidity. It's rather shy on fruit richness."
Fattoria Sardi 2015 Rosato (Toscana),20,3,3,4,3,3,4,"Made primarily from Sangiovese, with some Malvasia and other white grapes, this offers aromas of red berry and a yeasty whiff of bread dough. The bright, enjoyable palate offers ripe cherry and hint of pastry cream while a note of honeydew melon marks the close."
Ferrari-Carano 2014 Siena Red (Sonoma County),8,4,3,4,3,3,4,"This blend of Sangiovese, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and other varieties plays well to type. It shows a wealth of ripe, dusty black fruit that's richly round and soft on the palate, approachable and lightly oaked."
Folie 횪 Deux 2015 Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),48,4,3,4,3,2,4,"This wine has a touch of perceptible sweetness on its tropical nose, yet tastes dry, showing a straightforward approach to this crisp, coastal-grown variety. Apricot, melon and guava wrap around a lightness of body and texture."
Franciscan 2013 Magnificat Meritage (Napa Valley),18,3,3,3,3,5,1,"All red Bordeaux varieties are represented in this blend, except for Petit Verdot. Together, they offer a simple tannic structure that strengthens a chewiness of leather, tobacco and a touch of cedar. Full bodied, it's a ripe, bold and brawny wine."
Fuchs 2015 Gr체ner Veltliner (Burgenland),30,3,3,4,3,3,4,"Freshness characterizes the nose: green pear, ivy leaves and citrus notes play on nose and palate. This is light footed, easy drinking and charming. Drink soon while flavors are fresh."
G책rd 2014 Grand Klasse Reserve Lawrence Vineyards Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,3,3,4,3,4,2,"Barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of Creamsicle and baking spice. The palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. It provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times."
Henry Fessy 2015 Juli챕nas,35,3,4,3,4,4,2,"This is a dense wine, packed with both tannins and acidity. It brings out the ageworthiness of this appellation with its rich potential and dark mineral texture. Drink this concentrated cru wine from 2018."
Henry Fessy 2015 R챕gni챕,16,3,3,4,3,4,3,"The wine comes from one of the cru estates followed by this negociant house. It is a light, ripe and fruity wine. With its attractive red-berry flavors, finished with crisp acidity, it is accessible and ready to drink."
Heron Hill 2015 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),24,4,3,4,3,2,2,A wisp of bramble extends a savory tone from nose to finish on this otherwise bright bristling wine. Delicate honey tones register as off dry on the palate but balance neatly alongside flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears. The finish is marked by a touch of pencil lead. Drink now through 2020.
Serpaia di Endrizzi 2010 Dono Riserva (Morellino di Scansano),20,3,4,3,4,3,2,"Forest floor, menthol, espresso, cranberry and pressed violet aromas take shape in the glass. The lean linear palate shows dried sour cherry, licorice and coffee bean alongside assertive close-grained tannins. Even though the tannins are still firm, drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
Soquel Vineyards 2013 Intreccio Library Selection Red (Napa Valley),55,5,3,5,3,4,5,"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate. With a core of tobacco, tar and graphite, it complements the fruity with the savory, ending simply and elegantly."
Ventosa 2015 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),,4,3,4,3,4,3,"Fresh apple, lemon and pear flavors are accented by a hint of smoked nuts in this bold, full-bodied Pinot Gris. Rich and a bit creamy in mouthfeel yet balanced briskly, it's a satisfying white with wide pairing appeal. Drink now through 2019."

Lamoreaux Landing 2014 Yellow Dog Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),75,4,3,5,5,3,3,Intensely smoky tones of struck flint and ash extend throughout this otherwise bright nimble Riesling.

Leyda 2015 Single Vineyard Falaris Hill Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),40,5,3,5,5,3,3,"A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition, with roundness along the edges of the palate. Apple and nectarine flavors are lightly oaked and salty, while this holds form on a high-acid finish."
Madonna Alta 2014 Nativo Red (Toscana),17,3,2,4,3,3,3,"Made with 65% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and thyme. The easygoing palate delivers black cherry and cinnamon alongside smooth tannins."

Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2014 Castiglioni Red (Toscana),20,3,4,5,4,3,2,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese, this pleasant red has aromas of dark-skinned fruit, toast and a whiff of espresso.

Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2015 Ammiraglia Massovivo Vermentino (Toscana),80,5,3,5,3,3,3,"Aromas of yellow stone fruit, white spring flower and a whiff of citrus lift out of the glass. The soft round palate offers ripe apricot, yellow peach and a hint of candied nectarine zest."
Martin Ranch 2014 J.D. Hurley Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley),55,5,3,5,3,3,3,"Lots of spearmint, coyote mint, hot licorice, ginger snaps and Dr Pepper spice up the strawberry fruit of this wine that provides a very herbal take on the grape. Oregano, marjoram, thyme and dill all make a showing on the sip, against a backbone of sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finishing on cedar."
Ornellaia 2014 Le Volte Red (Toscana),24,3,2,3,2,4,3,"An easy-drinking blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of red berry, toast, herb and roasted coffee bean.

Pardon et Fils 2015 Les Quartelets (Brouilly),14,4,4,3,3,3,3,"Produced from cru vines at the base of Mount Brouilly, the wine has structure as well as ripe black-plum fruits. It is generous and its fruit is well balanced by acidity and solid tannins. The wines is ready to drink."
Nicosia 2013 Vulk횪 Bianco (Etna),43,3,3,4,4,3,3,"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity."
Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),26,3,4,5,4,3,4,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016."
Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),10,3,4,4,5,4,3,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented."
St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),,3,3,5,4,3,3,"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish."
Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),26,3,5,3,3,5,3,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew."
Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),25,3,3,5,4,4,3,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby."
Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria),21,4,3,5,4,4,3,"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins."

Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gew체rztraminer (Rheinhessen),62,3,3,5,3,2,2,"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint."
Jean-Baptiste Adam 2012 Les Natures Pinot Gris (Alsace),44,3,3,5,4,4,2,This has great depth of flavor with its fresh apple and pear fruits and touch of spice. It's off dry while balanced with acidity and a crisp texture. Drink now.
Kirkland Signature 2011 Mountain Cuv챕e Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),44,5,5,4,3,4,4,"Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility."
Leon Beyer 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),15,3,3,4,5,5,1,"This is a dry wine, very spicy, with a tight, taut texture and strongly mineral character layered with citrus as well as pepper. It's a food wine with its almost crisp aftertaste."

Masseria Setteporte 2012 Rosso (Etna),14,5,5,3,3,5,3,"This is dominated by oak and oak-driven aromas that include roasted coffee bean, espresso, coconut and vanilla that carry over to the palate, together with plum and chocolate. Astringent, drying tannins give it a rather abrupt finish."
Mirassou 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),26,3,3,4,3,5,4,"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple.

Felix Lavaque 2010 Felix Malbec (Cafayate),22,3,3,5,5,4,4,"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance."
Gaucho Andino 2011 Winemaker Selection Malbec (Mendoza),35,3,3,5,3,5,3,"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot."
Pradorey 2010 Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua Single Vineyard Crianza (Ribera del Duero),44,3,3,5,3,5,3,"Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino. Flavors of clove and woodspice sit on top of blackberry fruit, then hickory and other forceful oak-based aromas rise up and dominate the finish."
Qui챕vremont 2012 Meritage (Virginia),30,3,3,5,3,5,3,"Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper.

Qui챕vremont 2012 Vin de Maison Red (Virginia),,3,3,5,3,5,3,"Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity."
Acrobat 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),17,5,3,4,3,4,3,"A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated."

Bianchi 2011 Signature Selection Merlot (Paso Robles),60,3,3,5,5,2,3,"This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice."
Canicatt챙 2009 Aynat Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),40,3,5,4,4,5,1,"Aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans. Firm but drying tannins provide the framework."
Castello di Amorosa 2011 King Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),65,3,3,5,3,5,5,"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture."
Stemmari 2013 Dalila White (Terre Siciliane),15,3,3,5,4,2,3,"Pretty aromas of yellow flower and stone fruit lead the nose. The bright palate offers yellow apple, apricot, vanilla and delicate notes of lightly toasted oak alongside crisp acidity."

Terre di Giurfo 2011 Mascaria Barricato (Cerasuolo di Vittoria),,3,5,5,5,5,3,"Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins."
Clarksburg Wine Company 2010 Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),18,4,3,4,3,3,3,"Clarksburg is becoming a haven for Chenin Blanc in California. This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold."
Domaine de la Madone 2012 Nouveau (Beaujolais-Villages),25,3,2,5,3,3,3,"Red cherry fruit comes laced with light tannins, giving this bright wine an open, juicy character."
Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Calan챙ca Nero d'Avola-Merlot Red (Sicilia),9,3,3,5,3,3,3,"Merlot and Nero d'Avola form the base for this easy red wine that would pair with fettuccine and meat sauce or pork roast. The quality of the fruit is clean, bright and sharp."

Envolve 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),16,4,3,5,5,2,1,"This shows a tart, green gooseberry flavor that is similar to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Other notes include tropical fruit, orange and honey. Unoaked, with a splash of Muscat, this has commendable dryness and acidity."
Erath 2010 Hyland Pinot Noir (McMinnville),21,5,5,5,3,4,3,"As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes."
Estampa 2011 Estate Viognier-Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),11,5,3,5,3,4,4,"White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime.

Hawkins Cellars 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),26,3,5,4,3,5,3,"A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins."

Robert Hall 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),,5,3,5,5,5,1,"The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability.

Tarara 2010 #SocialSecret Red (Virginia),25,5,4,3,3,5,4,"Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes.

Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Sallier de la Tour Inzolia (Sicilia),450,3,3,4,4,4,2,"Spicy, fresh and clean, this would pair with fried seafood or spaghetti con vongole. It offers pretty citrus tones followed by a drying mineral nuance."
The White Knight 2011 Riesling (Lake County),30,5,3,3,5,3,3,"This is a sweet wine with flavors of white sugar, orange, honey and vanilla, all brightened by crisp acidity."
Trump 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Monticello),16,3,3,5,5,4,3,"This bottling resembles the New Zealand paradigm of Sauvignon Blanc, bearing aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit and kiwi; a sprinkling of graham cracker adds interest.

Vignerons de Bel Air 2011 Et챕 Indien (Brouilly),50,5,4,5,3,4,4,"Soft and fruity, this is a generous, ripe wine that's full of juicy red-cherry fruits and gentle tannins. It has some richness, giving a sweet character to this open, ready-to-drink wine."

It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure."
Tenuta di Sesta 2011 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),15,3,4,4,3,4,3,"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years."
Terlan 2014 Nova Domus Riserva White (Alto Adige),16,3,3,5,4,2,3,"Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity."
Yatir 2011 Syrah (Judean Hills),14,3,4,5,3,4,4,"This wine features pleasing aromas of raspberry, jumper berry and black pepper. There is a nice mélange of fruit and spice flavors, notably black cherry, dark plums, anise, and cardamom. Smooth tannins ply the palate right into a bright finish that bears a touch of salinity."
Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2012 Montes Claros Garrafeira Red (Alentejo),,3,3,5,5,5,5,"A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink."
J. Lohr 2014 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles),42,4,3,4,3,4,3,"This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rhône varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors."
J. Lohr 2015 October Night Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),10,4,3,3,4,5,3,"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish."
Courtney Benham 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),24,3,4,5,3,5,5,"This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak."
Del Carlo Winery 2014 Home Ranch Teldeschi Vineyards Century Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),14,3,3,5,4,4,2,"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice."
Delaire Graff 2013 Reserve White (Coastal Region),19,3,3,5,5,5,5,"A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% Sémillon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now–2019."
Domaine St Pierre 2014 Red (C척tes du Rh척ne),42,3,3,5,3,4,5,"Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now."
Eikendal 2014 Chardonnay (Western Cape),16,3,3,5,5,5,5,"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now."
Famille Perrin 2013 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras),15,3,4,5,4,4,3,"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025."
Matarromera 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),30,3,3,5,4,4,3,"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile."
MCV 2014 1105 Red (Paso Robles),13,3,3,4,3,2,3,"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate."
Mounts 2014 Verah Red (Dry Creek Valley),50,3,3,4,5,4,3,"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone."
Or Haganuz 2014 French Blend Red (Galilee),47,3,4,4,5,5,2,"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish."
Podere Scopetone 2012 Brunello di Montalcino,118,3,4,3,5,5,3,"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025."
